Linux Firewall – Detailed UFW Report

1. Introduction
In this task, I performed a hands-on practical on the Linux firewall using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). The objective was to enable the firewall, create a rule to block port 23 (Telnet), test the rule, and remove it after verification.This helped me understand how Linux filters traffic using firewall rules.

2. Tools & Environment
- Linux (Ubuntu/Kali/Debian)
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Telnet or Netcat for testing

3. Steps Performed

Step 1: Check UFW Status
Command:
sudo ufw status
The firewall was inactive.

Step 2: Enable the Firewall
Command:
sudo ufw enable
This activated the firewall and enabled protection.

Step 3: Check Existing Rules
Command:
sudo ufw status numbered
No rules were present at this point.

Step 4: Block Port 23 (Telnet)
Command:
sudo ufw deny 23
This added a firewall rule to block Telnet traffic on port 23.

Step 5: Confirm the Rule
Command:
sudo ufw status numbered
The deny rule for port 23 appeared in the list.

Step 6: Test the Rule
Command:
telnet 127.0.0.1 23
Result:
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
This confirmed that the firewall successfully blocked port 23.

Step 7: Remove the Rule
Command:
sudo ufw status numbered
Identify the rule number.

Then:
sudo ufw delete <rule_number>
The rule was removed successfully.

4. Conclusion
This task helped me understand how UFW manages firewall rules in Linux. I learned how to enable the firewall, add a deny rule, test it, and delete it when no longer needed. The connection refusal message confirmed that the firewall was working as expected.
