Windows Firewall – Practical Task Report

Introduction

In this task, I worked with the Windows Firewall to understand how to view existing rules, create a new rule to block a specific port, and test whether the firewall is working correctly. The focus was to block port 23 (Telnet) and verify the result.

What I Did
1.I opened Windows Defender Firewall and went to Advanced Settings, where all the inbound and outbound rules are managed.
2. Checked Current Firewall Rules
I clicked on Inbound Rules to see what rules were already applied on my system. This gave me an idea of how traffic is normally allowed or blocked.
Creating and Testing the Firewall Rule
3. Blocked Port 23 (Telnet)
I created a new inbound rule to block port 23, which is used by Telnet.

Steps followed:
Chose Port → TCP
Entered 23
Selected Block the connection
Applied it to Domain, Private, and Public
Named the rule Block_port_23

4. Tested the Block Rule
To check if the rule was actually working, I used this command after enabling Telnet:

telnet 127.0.0.1 23
The result showed:
"Could not open connection to the host… Connect failed"
This confirmed that the firewall successfully blocked port 23.

5. Removed the Test Rule
Once the testing was completed, I deleted the rule Block_port_23 to restore the firewall to its normal state.

Conclusion
This task helped me understand how Windows Firewall filters network traffic. By creating a rule to block port 23 and testing it, I learned how firewall rules affect the connection attempts. The failed Telnet connection confirmed that the firewall rule was working exactly as expected.
